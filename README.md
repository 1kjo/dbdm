The data set which we worked on belongs to a French bakery. The dataset
provides the daily transaction details of customers from 2021-01-01 to
2022-09-30. The dataset can be found at:

We did frequent pattern mining and clustering on the data. The code for the
analysis is in the Jupyter notebooks.

We implemented K-Prototype (a mix of K-Means and K-Modes) as well as the
Apriori algorithm.
